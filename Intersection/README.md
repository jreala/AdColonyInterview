# Intersection Test
To run the project, open the index.html file in your browser of choice (I used Chrome). 
To create the rectangles, enter your values and then click create. 
To move the rectangles, left click the one you wish to move and it will attach to your mouse, left click again to place it. 
When the rectangles intersect, they will change to red, otherwise they will be blue.
